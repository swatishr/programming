# Height of a binary tree

The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node in the tree. In other words, it is the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf.

The height of a binary tree can vary depending on its structure. In the best case, when the tree is perfectly balanced (e.g., a complete binary tree), the height is logarithmic in the number of nodes. For example, in a complete binary tree with N nodes, the height is O(log N) base 2.

However, in the worst case, when the binary tree is skewed (e.g., a degenerate tree where each node has only one child), the height can be equal to the number of nodes in the tree, making it O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

So, the height of a binary tree can range from O(log N) to O(N), depending on its shape and balance.
