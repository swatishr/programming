# For in-built BST, Python doesn't have a data structure in its standard library, 
# but there is a package that you can import

#  => sortedcontainers package is not available in std library, 
# so it might not be useful on Coderpads

# Python doesn't have structures like TreeSet in Java because it heavily relies on dict and it has made dict highly efficient 
# that it doesn't need a tree implementation.

# from sortedcontainers import SortedList

# Initialize a tree:   sortedList = SortedList() or if you want to specify a key SortedList(key=lambda x: x.val)

# Add element to the list: sortedList.add(num)

# Pop max i.e. last element from the list: num = sortedList.pop()

# Remove some element from the tree: sortedList.discard(num)

# Read last element from the tree: sortedList[-1]
