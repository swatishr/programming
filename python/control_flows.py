# range is a function that takes start value, stop value, and step as arguments. It doesn't return a list, but an iterable.
# Iterable is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, 
# but it doesnâ€™t really create a list of sequenced numbers, thus saving space.

# so, you can also pass range function as arguments to the functions that accept iterable objects, one such example is sum() function.

print("\nSum of range over 6: ", sum(range(6))) # 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15


#### ----- break, continue, for...else

# Yes, you already what break and continue does in the for loops, if you come from C, Java, Go
# But, in Python, you can also have an else attached to a for loop.
# the else part of for loop runs after the loop reaches its final iteration. It doesn't run when a break is executed inside for. 

# Find all the prime numbers till a given number n

n = 10
for i in range(2, n):
    for factor in range(2,i//2+1):
        if i%factor == 0:

#### --- pass statement---

# They do nothing, used when the code is needed but we need no action. It's mainly used when you are creating minimal classes 
# or as a placeholder for the abstraction that you have created while writing code, so that you can revisit and fill it out
        
# while True:
#     pass # Busy waiting for keyboard contorl (Ctrl+C)

#### --- match statement ---
# match statement was introduced in 3.10. Fairly recent, as I write it.
# it's similar to switch..case in other languages. It can be matched to literals, so exactly same behavior as like switch..case.
# _ acts as a default case as shown in the below example. You can combine several literals in a single pattern by using | ("or" operator)
# Interestingly, it also provides different additional features, including unpacking assignments and binding to variables, and you can use if with case statements as guard rules.

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
